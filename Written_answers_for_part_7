At this point, we have implemented through part 7, and after running our code with the argument "-j 30,3,2", we received the following output:

A set of random number is: [62, 64, 88, 91, 426, 535, 637, 662, 786, 807, 1226, 1287, 1301, 1371, 1442, 1554, 1589, 1672, 1715, 1783, 1792, 2001, 2121, 2123, 2378, 2474, 2614, 2661, 2765, 2883]

What we can conclude is that no random point chosen in the beginning was at the "middle" since the word changed after the first iteration. We would be surprised if one of the points chosen had been the first chosen word, or had the first iteration chosen the next closest word for each iteration after.
